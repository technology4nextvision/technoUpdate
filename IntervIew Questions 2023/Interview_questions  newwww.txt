Core Java
=========
1-> input String Array ["abc","tkd","bca","fgd","cab","dfg","aabc"]
    write a method to print output like below
    ["abc","bca","cab"]
    ["tkd"]
    ["fgd","dfg"]
    ["aabc"]
    
    In the above output you can see each array contains the word which has exact same letters and also same no of letter. i.e "abc" can become "bca"

2-> Hash TreeSet works. Can we add different type of object to TreeSet(i.e Integer,String,Float)

3-> Association, Aggregation and Composition

4->   class A{}
      class B extends{}
      
      what will happen for below code
      1-> B b = new A();
      2-> B b = (B) new A();
      
5->   int a[] = new int[]{3,4,5,6,7}
      
      what will happen for below code
      for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++){
        sysout(a[i])
        break;
        sysout(a[i])
      }
      
      what will happen for below code
      for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++){
        sysout(a[i])
        continue;
      }
6-> input array [5,6,4,7,2,5]
    output [6,7,7,-1,5,-1]
    
    for each element we have to find next higher no of current number
    suppose for i=0 i.e 5 the next higher number is 6
    for i=3 i.e 7 there is no next higher number so -1
    for i=5 i.e 5 there is no next higher number so -1
    
    (try to mimize the time complexity. Do it in O(n) or O(n logn))
7->What is Functional interface and whta is lambda expression.

8-> Can you write the interface of Predicate whatever is given by Java.

9->input array [1,3,4,7,8,9,10] and 2

    output-> find the no of pairs whosedifference is "2" like 3-1=2
    10-8=2
    9-7= 2
    
    so the output is 3(no of pairs that has difference of 2) if there is no pairs return -1
    (try to minimize the time complexity)
    
10->Can you explain the different parts of JVM memory. And how the memory managements works in JVM.

11-> How Garbage Collection works in java

12-> How to monitor your JVM and findout DeadLock in application and findout if there is any memory leak.

13-> Input a map with <Integer, String>
      1 -> Tarun
      2 -> Abhisek
      3 -> Rakesh
      4 -> Tarun
      5 -> Rakesh
      
      remove the duplicate values from map and print the kay,value in sorted order of values like 2-> Abhisek, 3->Rakesh, 1->Tarun
14-> given a array of data. Use Stream, filter the data,collect the data to map

15-> How many ways we can create Thread. What will happen if we call run() directly. Ho to make thread Deamon

16-> What is WeakHashMap. Give me a scenario where we can use it

18-> How to a make a Immutable class

19-> You have a class "Demo" where you have overriden hasCode() and equals() method. where hasCode() returns 1 every time and equals() return false every time.
    Set<Demo> a= new HashSet<>();
    for(int i=0;i<100;i++ ){
      a.add(new Demo());
    }

    What will be output of a.size();
